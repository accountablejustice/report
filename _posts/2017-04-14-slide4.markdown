This report is a Data-Driven Document and contains many interactive data visualizations.<sup>10</sup> Hovering over most charts will reveal additional levels of detail, and many charts are clickable. Two charts (a cartogram of US prison populations and a timeline showing Florida's prison growth) require you to click on them in order to view the visualization. Where you are required to click, you will see this symbol <img src="img/slides/click.svg" width="30">.
