This report is a Data-Driven Document and contains many interactive data visualizations. Hovering over most charts will reveal additional levels of detail, and many charts are clickable. Two charts (a cartogram of US prison populations and a timeline showing Florida's prison growth) require you to click on them in order to view the visualization.<sup>1</sup> Where you are required to click, you will see this symbol <img src="img/slides/click.svg" width="30">.
