title: Racial and jurisdictional disparities are defining features of Florida's criminal justice system.
description: |
---
In Florida's criminal justice system, your ZIP code and
the color of your skin can sometimes matter more than your behavior.
Disparities between circuits are a product of the criminal justice
system's relative de-centralization. Each circuit has its own
judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, probation officers,
and police forces. The decisions these people make -- individually
and collectively -- determine whom is punished and how.

Racial and jurisdictional disparities are most apparent at the
"lower ends" of the criminal justice system where decision-makers
have more discretion. Florida's criminal justice system
produces significant racial and jurisdictional disparities, especially
in the enforcement of the terms of probation and of drug offenses.
