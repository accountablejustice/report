title: Racial and jurisdictional disparities are defining features of Florida's criminal justice system.
description: |
---
In Florida's criminal justice system, your ZIP code and
the color of your skin can sometimes matter more than your behavior.
Disparities between circuits are a product of the criminal justice
system's relative decentralization. Each circuit has its own
judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, probation officers,
and police forces. The decisions these people make --- individually
and collectively --- determine who is punished and how.

Racial and jurisdictional disparities are most apparent in analyses of less serious cases (like drug offense and probation violations) where decision-makers
exercise more discretion. Florida's criminal justice system
produces significant racial and jurisdictional disparities, especially
in the enforcement of the terms of probation and of drug offenses.
