This report uses two methodologies for determining an individual's offense.
By either measure, non-violent offenses account for a significant
majority of prison admissions.

### Committing Offense
The Committing Offense is the most serious charge for which an individual is sentenced to prison.
It prioritizes violent offenses over property, drug, and other offenses. The Committing Offense
variable captures violations of probation, parole, and conditional release.<sup>10</sup>

### Longest Sentenced Offense
The Longest Sentenced Offense is the offense that carries the longest sentence, regardless of the
seriousness of the offense. However, when two offenses carry the same sentence, this variable, like
Committing Offense, prioritizes violence. In cases where an individual is admitted to prison for a
violation of probation or parole, the Longest Sentenced Offense reveals the underlying charge.
