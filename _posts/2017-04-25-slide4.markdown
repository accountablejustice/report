title: Most people admitted to prison have short sentences. Most people currently in prison are serving very long sentences.
---
People with relatively short sentences (defined here as three years or less) make up most of the turnover of the prison system, but a relatively small portion of the prison population. They comprise 55 percent of all people admitted to prison each year, but amount to only 17 percent of the prison population.

On the other hand, people with very long sentences (12 years or longer) make up very little of the turnover but comprise the bulk of the prison population. People with very long sentences make up only 9 percent of prison admissions, but, because they stay for so long, they amount to 49 percent of the population.
