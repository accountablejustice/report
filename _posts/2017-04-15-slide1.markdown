title: The United States incarcerates more of its citizens than any other country.
link:  DataVisualizations/international.html

There are currently more than 1.5 million people in American prisons, and another 700,000 in local jails. At the end of 2015, 153,000 Floridians were in prison or jail. Florida's incarceration rate is 20 percent higher than the national average.

No other country incarcerates as many people as the United States. The US incarceration rate, of 666 people per 100,000 residents, is nearly five times higher than that of the United Kingdom, which itself has a relatively high rate of incarceration compared to other economically developed democracies.
Only Cuba and Russia, both with non-democratic governments, begin to approach
the United States when it comes to incarceration.<sup>11</sup>


<small>Note: North Korea does not provide reliable data, but the
[best estimates available](https://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/HRNK_HiddenGulag2_Web_5-18.pdf)
conclude that North Korea confines between 150,000 and 200,000 people, resulting in
 an incarceration rate between 600 and 800 [per 100,000 residents](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL).
These data indicate that North Korea is the
only sizable country whose incarceration rate may be higher than that of the
United States.</small>
