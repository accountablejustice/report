There are currently more than 1.5 million people in American prisons, and another 700,000 in local jails.
No other country incarcerates this many people. The US incarceration rate, of 698 people per one
hundred thousand residents, is nearly five times higher than that of the United Kingdom, which itself
has a relatively high rate of incarceration compared to other economically developed democracies.
Only Cuba and Russia, both with non-democratic governments, begin to approach
the United States when it comes to incarceration.<sup>1</sup>

<small>Note: North Korea does not provide reliable data, but the
[best estimates available](https://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/HRNK_HiddenGulag2_Web_5-18.pdf)
conclude that confines between 150,000 and 200,000 people, resulting in
 an incarceration rate between 600 and 800 [per 100,000 residents](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL).
These data indicate that North Korea is the
only country whose incarceration rate may be higher than that of the
United States.</small>
