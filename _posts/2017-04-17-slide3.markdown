title: Most probation violators were on probation for a non-violent offense.
---
More than 70% of people sent to prison or violations of probation in FY2015
were on probation for a non-violent offense. The most common
underlying offenses (the offenses for which an individual was under
probation supervision) involved drugs and property.

The majority of probation violators in FY2015 had no
record of a violent felony in their Florida Department of Corrections
record. (This includes only cases sentenced to state prison or
a form of community supervision.)

<small><small> Note: A small  number of cases of violations of probation involved
very serious offenses, such as murder and some sex offenses,
provoking the question of why people with very serious offenses were
placed on probation. These cases mostly involved the use of blended
sentences: A court sentenced the initial offense to a term of imprisonment
followed by a term of probation. This mean that, after serving the full term
 of imprisonment, individuals with such sentences were placed on probation
 after their release. Like anyone on probation, these individuals
 could have their probation revoked for failing to fully comply with
 its terms. Most people whose underlying offense was very serious
 had already served a prison sentence before having their probation revoked.</small></small>
