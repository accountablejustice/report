title: In FY2015, Florida spent more $300 million to imprison people for drug offenses.

In a FY2015 snapshot, 15,042 people were in prison for drug offenses.
 The cost of incarcerating these people was $301.9 million.

There are vast differences in how Florida's circuits use incarceration
 when it comes to drug offenses, even though the costs of incarceration
 are shared by all of Florida's jurisdictions. In FY2015, Florida's 4<sup>th</sup>
 Circuit (Jacksonville) was responsible for almost $30 million
 spent by the state to imprison people for drug offenses.
