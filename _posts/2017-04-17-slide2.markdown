The Department of Corrections, along with courts, has broad discretion
in how to treat technical violations and other misbehavior that, itself,
does not violate the law. From 2003 until mid-2008, the Department of Corrections
maintained a "Zero Tolerance" policy regarding technical violations. This
meant probation officers were required to file violations whenever someone
under their supervision was not in full compliance -- even when an officer
believed lack of full compliance did not threaten public safety.

Predictably, the Zero Tolerance policy resulted in many more people
being sent to prison for violations of probation. By FY2008, admissions
for violations of probation increased two-and-a-half fold.

Since the Department rescinded its Zero Tolerance policy, admissions
for VOPs are down significantly. Between FY2008 and
FY2012, VOPs fell 35 percent. Since 2012, prison admissions for VOPs have increased slightly. They remain 33 percent higher than they were prior to the Zero Tolerance policy.

The program, which had been piloted since 2013, allows judges to opt to use alternative responses to technical violations. The program is intended to increase efficiency, improve outcomes, and decrease revocations.</small></small>
