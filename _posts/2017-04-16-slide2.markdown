### What's the difference between these definitions?
Committing Offense is most valuable in determining why someone
was sentenced to prison. In showing probation and parole violations,
it emphasizes the role that parallel criminal justice institutions play in mass incarceration
and highlights reforms in _practice_ that could be implemented administratively.

Longest Sentenced Offense is most useful in understanding what changes in law
are required to reduce the number of people Florida holds in prison, particularly as they
might relate to sentencing.

For detailed examples of how and when these methodologies are most useful, see [Appendix A](#AppendixA).
