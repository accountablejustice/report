In every circuit except for the 9th (Orlando) and 11th (Miami), the incarceration rate of black adults solely for drugs
is higher than the total incarceration rate for similar countries. The 17th (Palm Beach) has a drug incarceration rate
for black adults of 149 per 100,000. The United Kingdom's incarceration rate for _all offenses_ is 147 per 100,000.

Though to a less extreme degree, white Floridians are also heavily impacted by the War on Drugs. In some rural areas,
such as the 3rd (Lake City) and 14th (Panama City) Circuits, the white adult drug incarceration rates are 194 and 149,
respectively.
