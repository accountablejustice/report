title: Most people sent to prison have relatively short sentences.
description: |
---
Of the 30,000 people admitted to prison in FY2015, 57% had a sentence
of three years or less. People serving very long sentences (12 years or
longer) make up only 6% of people admitted to prison.

However, because people with long sentences stay in prison for long
periods of time, they make up the majority of people who are currently
in prison. 45% of current prisoners are serving sentences of 12 years or longer.
