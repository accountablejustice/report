title: Many people in prison were convicted of violent offenses, partially as a result of parole policies and mandatory minimum sentencing.

With 55% of its prison population incarcerated for a violent offense in a FY2015 snapshot, Florida is an outlier among US states. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Florida Legislature passed laws with slogans like "truth in sentencing" and "life means life," and abolished parole and other forms of discretionary release. These laws and policies have resulted in people staying in prison for extremely long periods of time, often beyond the point where they ceased to be a risk to public safety. Mandatory minimum sentences (especially 10-20-Life) also forced judges to impose extremely long prison sentences. Florida is one of only a handful of states states that do not have a system for releasing people who served significant periods of time and do not pose a risk to public safety.<sup>15</sup>

Eleven percent of Florida's prison population (12,420 people) was elderly (55 or older) in FY2015. Elderly inmates demographic group that costs the state significantly more to imprison, especially in expenses related to health care.<br>
