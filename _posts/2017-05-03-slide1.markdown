2. A small island nation in the Indian Ocean, Seychelles, has the highest incarceration rate in the world, according to the World Prison Brief. The Seychelles incarcerates fewer than 800 people, Data for OECD countries comes from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), [_Society at a Glance 2016_](http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/social-issues-migration-health/society-at-a-glance-2016_9789264261488-en#page135) (Paris: OECD Publishing, 2016), p. 133.

3. The data underlying this visualization show only state imprisonment, not other types of incarceration (which could include detention in local jails, federal imprisonment, immigration detention, and juvenile incarceration). Data from 1978 to 2015 are drawn from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, [National Prisoner Statistics: Corrections Statistical Analayis Tool - Prisoners](http://www.bjs.gov/nps)	. Data from 1970 to 1977 are calculated from Bureau of Justice Statistics, [_Bulletin: Prisoners 1925 - 1981_](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/p2581.pdf), (1982) and US Census Bureau, Population in the United States, 1900-2014 ([accessed via API through Google's Public Data reference center](https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=kf7tgg1uo9ude_&hl=en&dl=en)). These data come with many caveats, and different states, at different times, counted their prison populations slightly differently.

12. In this chart, Parole Violations refer to multiple types of conditional release that administered by the Florida Commission on Offender Review. Parole was largely abolished in 1983, meaning only people sentenced prior to 1983 (with the exception of people convicted of capital offenses prior to 1994) are under the parole system. The Commission on Offender Review nonetheless administrates several other forms of conditional release, including Conditional Release, Control Release Program, Conditional Medical Release, and the Addiction Recovery Supervision Program. In FY2016, the Florida Commission on Offender Review revoked 1,835 conditional releases (of one form or another), making it a significant contributor to Florida's prison population.

17. Since Florida effectively abolished parole in 1983, more than a dozen states followed. Most states, however, maintain mechanisms for discretionary release. For more details about the national context of parole and discretionary release, see Joan Petersilia, Edward Rhine, and Kevin Reitz, "The Future of Parole Release," in _Justice Futures: Reinventing American Criminal Justice, Vol. 42 of Crime and Justice: A Review of Research_, Michael Tonry, ed.

22. The Florida Department of Corrections adopted (relatively) full-scale digitization in 1998. Since then, more than 458,000 people have been prisoners in the state of Florida. Just over 99,000 of them are in prison today. 5,284 people have died in prison since 1998. The vast majority of the people who have been in prison -- more than 350,000 -- were released back into their communities. The Florida Department of Corrections digitized probation records in 1976. Since then, it has released almost 1.4 million people from supervision. Another 137,000 remain under the supervision of the Department of Corrections. Figures relating to prisoners, former prisoners, and current probationers are from the [April 2017 Public Records Requests for the OBIS Database](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/obis_request.html), maintained by the Florida Department of Corrections. Figures regarding former probationers are from a datas et proved to the Project on Accountable Justice by the Florida Department of Corrections titled "Former Probationers."
