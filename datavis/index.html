This Demmers Cartogram shows the US prison population in each state by year, since 1970. The size
of each state indicates the number of prisoners, and darker hues are assocated
with increased rates of incarceration. The data come from the Bureau
of Justice Statistics, and are available at www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/studies/36657.
Thanks to Chris Given, who created and shared the cartogram b.lock that I modified to make this visualization. To
explore the most recent data, click on any state.
