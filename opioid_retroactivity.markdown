title: Florida Rolled Back Parts of the War on Drugs, but Hundreds Remain in Prison under Obsolete Laws
subTitle: Justice Demands that Reforms Be Made Retroactive <br><br>November 2019
---

### The Problem
Florida law expansively defines trafficking in illegal drugs. To be convicted of drug trafficking, a defendant need not have actually trafficked or sold drugs—she merely must be in “constructive possession” of a certain quantity of a controlled substance. This has created a blurry line between trafficking and possession. Thousands of people are currently incarcerated in Florida prisons for drug “trafficking” offenses who  might have more fairly been charged with drug possession and offered opportunities for treatment outside of prison.

The Florida Legislature adopted its expansive definition of trafficking at the height of the War on Drugs to make it easier for prosecutors to secure convictions against people involved in moving large quantities of drugs through the state and sometimes to other parts of the country. Concerned that “Drug Kingpins” were receiving relatively light penalties, the Legislature wrote thresholds into the state’s drug laws that allowed courts to assume that, if a defendant possessed enough of a drug, she was trafficking it rather than simply possessing it. Some of these thresholds separated drug users from drug traffickers. For instance, Florida law requires that a person with constructive possession of 10,000 pounds of cannabis be sentenced to 15 years for trafficking. When your drug cache would test the towing capacity of an F-150, it seems fair to assume that it is intended for trafficking or distribution, not personal use.<sup><1</sup>

The problems arise in cases where the trafficking threshold is set so low that it confuses drug users with drug kingpins. Until 2014, Florida law set a trafficking threshold so low that possessing as few as seven hydrocodone pills resulted in a mandatory minimum trafficking sentence of three years. Possession of forty-four pills—equivalent to a twenty-two-day supply for patients prescribed two hydrocodone pills per day for chronic pain—resulted in a mandatory sentence of twenty-five years in prison. Incarcerating a single individual for the twenty-five-year mandatory minimum sentence associated with possessing as few as forty-four hydrocodone pills would cost the state more than $450,000.<sup>2</sup>

Judges who thought that these punishments were extreme or disproportionate could do little to prevent them. Because the trafficking statute imposed mandatory minimum sentences, the law tied the hands of judges and forced them to condemn thousands of Floridians to very long terms of imprisonment.

### The Florida Legislature Partially Addressed the Problem
In 2014, the Florida Legislature acknowledged that the trafficking threshold for prescription drugs were too low. Legislators passed laws that raised the thresholds significantly. The twenty-five year mandatory minimum threshold for hydrocodone increased from 44 pills to 462. The Legislature also added a new, seven-year mandatory minimum sentence for people possessing intermediate quantities of oxycodone or hydrocodone.


Though the revised thresholds continue to inappropriately address drug addiction through incarceration, they have reduced the number of Floridians sentenced each year to very long prison terms for possession of small quantities of prescription drugs.

### The Legislature Should Make the Current Thresholds Retroactive
Despite the change in law, hundreds of Floridians whose offenses occurred before the 2014 reforms remain incarcerated under the old thresholds. PAJ estimates that between 680 and 935 people could become eligible for early release if the 2014 legislation that reformed hydrocodone and oxycodone mandatory minimum sentences was made retroactive. The cost of incarcerating 680 people is $14,785,000 a year.<sup>4</sup> As is consistent with [recent reporting on the topic by the _Tampa Bay Times_](https://www.tampabay.com/special-reports/2019/11/13/hundreds-of-florida-inmates-are-serving-drug-sentences-no-longer-in-state-law/), women are disproportionately affected by the Legislature's failure to make the reforms retroactive. People incarcerated under the obsolete thresholds are twice as likely as typical prisoners to be women.<sup>5</sup>

#### ***The Florida Legislature reformed the state’s mandatory minimum drug trafficking thresholds because they imposed sentences that were wildly disproportionate to the crime. Justice demands that the reforms be made retroactive.***

<br>

### Retroactivity, Responsible Governance, and Fundamental Fairness
Opioid legislation is not the only area of law where fundamental fairness will require that reforms be made retroactive. Florida's prison population exceeded 100,000 in response to forty years of public policy that emphasized imprisonment at the expense of more effective mechanisms to promote public health and safety.

In 1970, Florida imprisoned fewer than 9,000 of its residents. In 2009, the number of people in Florida prisons exceeded 100,000.

[The exponential growth of Florida's criminal justice system](https://accountablejustice.github.io/report/#path) was due to forty years of laws and policies that no longer enjoy public support. The War on Drugs and other initiatives that resulted in very long terms of imprisonment are today viewed as monumental public policy failures. It produced crowded prisons that functioned as warehouses and it neglected community-based strategies that can actually reduce the social and economic harms drug abuse can inflict.<sup>6</sup> Most citizens view the [$2.7 billion the state spends each year to operate 144 prison facilities](http://dc.state.fl.us/pub/annual/1718/FDC_AR2017-18.pdf) as a waste.

The Florida Legislature has a public mandate to roll back mass incarceration and embrace responsible policies to promote safety. Un-making mass incarceration in Florida is responsible governance, and it will require revisiting and revising forty years of failed policies.

### *A Note on Implementation*
Sentencing in Florida’s criminal courts is often more complicated than might appear at first glance, especially in cases where a defendant is sentenced for multiple offenses. Some people incarcerated for drug crimes were convicted of multiple offenses, which typically involved more than one type of drug or charges relating to paraphernalia. In many cases where a defendant is convicted of multiple similar offenses, Florida courts impose the same sentence for each offense, even if one charge requires a mandatory minimum sentence and an additional charge gives the judge discretion. Applying the same sentence for different offenses is sometimes more a matter of administrative efficiency than careful judgement. After all, barring a change in law, a defendant will serve the same term of imprisonment no matter how the sentence is constructed. As a result, approximately 250 prisoners are sentenced to a mandatory term for opioid trafficking and an equal, non-mandatory term for a less serious offense. As Florida makes the 2014 drug-law reforms retroactive, the Legislature should consider allowing prisoners who were simultaneously convicted of less serious offenses to seek relief and resentencing from the courts.

### Imprisonment Is Not Only Unnecessary--In Many Cases, It Makes Things Worse
The Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA), the research arm of the Florida Legislature, has [endorsed diverting more people from prison](http://www.oppaga.state.fl.us/MonitorDocs/Reports/pdf/1901rpt.pdf), in part because prisons produce significantly higher recidivism rates than community sanctions.<sup>7</sup>

Last year, Florida voters approved Amendment 11, which gave the Legislature the ability to make criminal justice reforms retroactive. In less than two months, Florida lawmakers will return for the 2020 Session with a mandate to shrink and reform the state's prison system, which is expensive and dangerous. The system is plagued by a runaway budget, staffing shortages, excessive mandatory overtime for staff, contraband and violence, aging facilities and prisoners, and a dearth of rehabilitation. As fiduciaries for public safety, state finances, and basic morality, Florida legislators must explore all options to take pressures off of the system, especially ways to reduce the current prison population.

Florida's prison system houses nearly 97,000 people but is only resourced to confine 87,000. Additionally, the state must prepare plans for the nearly 30,000 people who return to Florida’s communities each year. Whatever aspirations policymakers may have for a renewed, rehabilitative system, the present realities leave no room or time for patchwork fixes. The system is too large and unwieldy for more hires, better health care, or more slots for treatment and education to make a difference without dramatic reductions in the number of people incarcerated. As can be the case in moments of crisis, righting the ship requires lightening its load. Managing Florida's prisons--and managing efforts to reform them--demands reducing their size. Making reforms retroactive is key to doing so purposefully, safely, and justly.

### Methodology

PAJ used two methodologies to estimate the number of people potentially impacted if Florida’s 2014 opioid reforms were made retroactive. A more inclusive estimate considers people sentenced to a mandatory minimum term for opioid trafficking as well as people sentenced to an identical term of imprisonment for a less serious offense. A less inclusive estimate excludes people sentenced to equal terms of imprisonsonment for less serious offenses.

Using a July 2019 snapshot of people currently incarcerated in Florida prisons, PAJ identified 1,536 people convicted of opioid trafficking between 7/1/1999 and 6/30/2014. The longest sentenced offense for the vast majority of these prisoners (1,440) was an opioid trafficking offense.<sup>8</sup>

To estimate the potential impact of making the 2014 oxycodone and hydrocodone reforms retroactive, PAJ excluded the following groups:

*	94 prisoners who were sentenced to longer terms of imprisonment for offenses other than opioid trafficking;
*	158 prisoners who were committed for violent offenses in addition to opioid trafficking; and
*	200 prisoners who, in addition to having a mandatory minimum sentence for opioid trafficking, also had a mandatory minimum sentence for another mandatory minimum drug trafficking offense.

This left 1,093 prisoners. (11 prisoners were excluded for multiple factors.) However, because the Department of Corrections’ offense codes did not specify the type of opioid involved, this figure also included people convicted of trafficking opioids other than those targeted by the oxycodone or hydrocodone reforms.

To estimate how many of these prisoners are incarcerated for oxycodone or hydrocodone trafficking as opposed to other opioids, PAJ analyzed fifteen years of drug trafficking data from Pinellas County, where officials noted the type of drug involved rather than simply the offense code. The data contained all drug trafficking offenses filed between 1/1/1999 and 7/1/2014. PAJ limited the dataset to cases with a guilty adjudication and to cases involving the trafficking of opioids, leaving 666 cases in the Pinellas sample. Overall, 87% of opioid trafficking cases involved hydrocodone or oxycodone. However, this rate fluctuated significantly over time. Among cases where the offense occurred prior to 2005, 81% of cases involved hydrocodone or oxycodone. 95% of cases originating between 2005 and 2009 involved hydrocodone or oxycodone. And 82% of cases where the offense occurred in 2010 or later involved hydrocodone or oxycodone. These figures are in accordance with other research about hydrocodone and oxycodone prevalence in Florida and nationally.<sup>9</sup>

PAJ applied findings from the analysis from Pinellas County indicating the percentage of opioid trafficking that involved hydrocodone or oxycodone to sample of 1,093 prisoners incarcerated for opioid trafficking in the July 2019 snapshot. This resulted in an estimate of 936.

<br>

#### Methodology for Restricted Eligibility Estimate
Some prisoners sentenced to mandatory minimum terms were also sentenced for other offenses. A typical case might involve a three year mandatory sentence for opioid trafficking combined with a three year nonmandatory sentence for drug possession. Depending on how retroactivity were implemented, prisoners with multiple sentences may or may not become eligible for resentencing or release.

To estimate the impact of a more restricted eligibility, PAJ replicated the methodology for the less restricted eligibility scenario, except we excluded prisoners who had sentences for non-mandatory minimum offenses of equal length to their mandatory minimum sentence. The inclusion criteria for the more restricted implementation estimate were (all must apply):

*	Prisoners incarcerated in July 2019 for an opioid trafficking offense committed between 7/1/1999 and 6/30/2014;
*	Prisoners not incarcerated for a violent offense; and
*	Prisoners not sentenced for any offense to an equal or longer term than the mandatory minimum offense.

These more restrictive eligibility requirements yielded 792 prisoners in the July 2019 snapshot. PAJ then used the Pinellas County data (as described above) to estimate that 680 of these prisoners’ offenses involved hydrocodone or oxycodone and therefore would be eligible for relief if the 2014 reforms were made retroactive without allowances for people serving an identical sentence for a less serious offense.

For an overview of mandatory minimum policies and a comparison to other states, see [Greg Newburn and Sal Nuzzo, Mandatory Minimums, Crime, and Drug Abuse: Lessons Learned and Paths Ahead (The James Madison Institute, February 2019)](https://www.jamesmadison.org/mandatory-minimums-crime-and-drug-abuse-lessons-learned-and-paths-ahead/).

2. Similarly low trafficking thresholds affected sentences for people possessing other types of prescription drugs. Possession of 31 oxycodone pills resulted in a mandatory minimum prison sentence of three years; 108 pills in fifteen years; and 215 pills in twenty-five years. Florida’s low trafficking thresholds not only condemned people to prison for extremely long periods of time; they also unsustainably strained the state budget. This estimate is based on 2014 per diem costs of $49.49. [Florida Department of Corrections, 2013-14 Annual Report](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/annual/1314/AnnualReport-1314.pdf).

The current thresholds reflect changes made to the hydrocodone thresholds earlier this year. See FLA. STAT. § 314.14(3) (2019).
