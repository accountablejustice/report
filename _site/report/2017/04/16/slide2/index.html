<h2 id="note" class="offset">Editor's Note: Florida Criminal Justice Reform</h2>
<h3>Understanding the Challenges and Opportunities</h3>

<p>Another year has come and gone and the Florida Legislature failed to prioritize systemic criminal justice reform. Yet Florida’s prison system remains in crisis, plagued by years of documented problems in staffing, safety, health care, transportation, and facilities. This inaction assures the system persists as dire and dangerous, with no prescription yet written for sustained and systemic improvement.<sup>1</sup> Floridians deserve a deliberate and accountable response.</p>

<p>With 97,000 prisoners, another 135,000 people under probation or similar supervision, a staff of more than 20,000 employees, and numerous private contracts to manage, Florida’s prison system is massive. And reforming it is understandably a massive undertaking. But it can be done, though not through inaction.</p>

<p>As the third largest prison system in the country, the Florida Department of Corrections is an entity comparable in size to the populations of St. Petersburg or Orlando; it’s larger still than 43 of Florida’s 67 counties.<sup>2</sup> The expanse of the system also demands expense. Florida taxpayers will spend more than $2.4 billion this year, and will continue to spend at least as much each and every year for the foreseeable future. Florida also has one of the highest incarceration rates in the country–a rate more than 20% higher than the national average.<sup>3</sup></p>

<p>Florida policy makers should be readily able to answer how well these fundamental characteristics of Florida’s prison system–high incarceration rates and enormous public expenditures–meet rigorous standards for both safety and cost-efficiency. Do the current investments, practices, and policy strategies employed by our state’s criminal justice and correctional systems result in the safety returns Floridians expect and deserve?</p>

<p>We call attention to these questions, noting, that though Florida continues to experience a decades-low crime rate, the crime rate is 15% higher than the national average.<sup>4</sup>  We call further attention as we ponder the resulting outcomes evidenced as more than 30,000 people cycle in and out of the Florida prison system each year. Nearly all prisoners (87%) eventually return to our communities, so meeting the rehabilitative purposes of our corrections system is imperative for safety.  Yet 69% of prisoners are rearrested within three years of release.<sup>5</sup></p>

<p>While noting the many structural and operational deficiencies of the system, which the Project on Accountable Justice and others have addressed previously, this report illuminates areas for further discussion and remedy. In particular, Florida’s current sentencing regime demands a review.</p>

<p>Although prison admissions over the past decade declined 28%, sentence lengths increased by 22%.<sup>6</sup> How much more safety do Floridians get with this increase? “There is considerable research validated by the FDC (and others) that the length of imprisonment has no impact on recidivism rates.”<sup>7</sup></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Among national criminal justice reform advocates, Florida is the great ‘white whale.’ It is the state that every reformer dreams about as fervently as Captain Ahab dreamed about Moby-Dick. Over the last 10 years, most of the states in the American South have passed major reform legislation to improve public safety, cut wasteful spending, and better restore victims–but Florida, one of the biggest and most influential states in the country, has remained a stubborn exception.” Vikrant Reddy, Charles Koch Institute, <a href="https://www.jamesmadison.org/publications/detail/criminal-justice-reform-in-florida-2016-and-beyond">The Journal of the James Madison Institute</a> (October 2016).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We spend $300 million a year to incarcerate people for drug offenses, but less than $1.50 a day to educate and rehabilitate a prisoner. We release more than 30,000 people per year, yet 69% will be re-arrested within three years.</p>

<p>It’s true that by locking up dangerous people, the Florida prison system incapacitates some of the most dangerous criminals.  But it also true that the Florida prison system might more effectively leverage its resources–both financial and human–through shifting, as appropriate, more resources toward the expansion of safe and proven alternatives to prison, like community-driven sanctions and research-driven accountability mechanisms like veterans and drug courts.</p>

<p>Seventy percent of people entering prison in FY2015 were sentenced for a non-violent offense; fifty-five percent of prison admissions had no FDC record of any violent felony; we imprison more than 15,000 people for drug offenses. In these cases, is a prison sentence always the most beneficial and cost-effective response?</p>

<p>We did not get here overnight, nor will these problems be alleviated overnight. The condition Florida finds itself in is the result of decades of criminal justice policies that have often been at cross-purposes. Efforts by policy makers in years past to reform the system have proved meager in the face of laws and policies like mandatory minimums and sentencing enhancements. Like all public policy decisions, prison population expansion should have been met with tough accountability questions–the kinds of questions we ask readers to pose while looking at our findings and others.</p>

<p>We cannot stress enough that this will require the diligence of Florida’s policy makers to undergo a systemic policy and budget examination, which can only be supported through rigorous and continued data examination.  Otherwise, we implore, we will remain forever behind the eight ball. The Florida prison system will not fix itself.</p>

<p>A recent example occurred in the 2017 Session. The Florida Legislature increased the budget of the Department of Corrections by $35 million. These funds were needed. The state’s prison system is operating far below basic staffing levels vital to ensure basic safety, let alone provide the kinds of educational and rehabilitative programs that are proven to reduce re-offending when people are released. But these stop-gap funds will have only the most limited impacts; they are enough to replace some old vehicles, but fill only one quarter of the staffing deficit the system faces to ensure basic safety. Our taxpayer investments in Florida’s prison system should do more than merely get us through to the next fiscal year. There are many, many examples to reflect upon–many of which have been delivered previously to the Florida Legislature and the Governor.</p>

<p>Without significant change, Florida will remain on its current path, spending billions of taxpayer dollars without a plan beyond the next fiscal year. Of course, money for corrections means less money for everything else–most relevantly for proven alternatives to incarceration that measurably achieve more for public safety–for more officer training, drug treatment and community mental health programs, for specialized courts, for re-entry supports and services aimed to keep fewer people from returning to crime.</p>

<p>Florida can take a different path. We can make safely reducing our prison population a priority. We can reengineer our criminal justice system to serve the ends of public safety. And we can use research to ensure that we do this safely. Other states–Georgia, Texas, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Alabama, Mississippi and the latest neighbor added to the rolls, Louisiana–are leveraging data to cut costs better meeting the needs of their citizens as a result.<sup>8</sup></p>

<p>Floridians strongly support change. Seventy-two percent of us agree or strongly agree that it is important to reform the criminal justice system in Florida. Even more agree that the prison population is costing our country too much money. And almost two-thirds of Floridians want to find ways to release prisoners serving time for nonviolent offenses.<sup>9</sup> These results are instructional–and point to the public’s expectation that we must do better.</p>

<p>This report is an effort to help Florida’s understand the nature of some of the problems found in Florida’s criminal justice system, notably resulting in dangerous prisons. It shows who is going to prison and why, who is in prison and for how long, and suggests opportunities for reform. It reveals disparities that suggest that how the justice system treats you may depend more on where you live than what you do. Floridians must decide whether we will be party to a system that is failing, or embrace the immense opportunities to use data to drive change. Please think about this question as you read this report, and imagine a healthier correctional system that keeps us safe and wisely invests in what works to reduce crime and costs.</p>

<p>Mass incarceration affects all of the United States, but only California
and Texas have larger prison populations than Florida. Louisiana, Oklahoma,
and Delaware have the highest rates of incarceration. Florida’s imprisonment rate
(500 prisoners per 100,000 residents of all ages) is 20% higher than the
national average.</p>

<h2 id="path" class="offset">Florida's Path to 100,000 Prisoners</h2>

<h3 id="until-2000-new-york-and-florida-had-similar-prison-populations-and-imprisonment-rates-today-florida-incarcerates-twice-as-many-people">Until 2000, New York and Florida had similar prison populations and imprisonment rates. Today, Florida incarcerates twice as many people.</h3>
<p>As you watch the size of each state’s prison population expand in the cartogram above,
compare the trajectories of New York and Florida. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s,
the two states had similar prison populations and similar rates of imprisonment.
Both states were early adopters of laws that increased penalties for drugs
and lengthened sentences for violent offenses. After 2000, however, the
two states diverged. New York scaled back its War on Drugs and maintained
parole as a method to release people deemed to pose little threat to
public safety. Florida, on the other hand, doubled down on drug offenses -
passing laws to increase penalties for opioids and making possession
charges easier to prosecute. Florida also passed a law called “10 - 20 - Life,”
which established mandatory minimum sentences for people who used a gun
during a crime. (Some people sentenced to 20 years in prison
never hurt anyone and fired a warning shot in self-defense.) Florida’s abolition
of parole in 1983 also limited the ability of the state to release people
who had demonstrated rehabilitation and posed little or no threat to public safety. These policy divergences have culminated
in a profound difference: Florida has almost twice as many prisoners
as New York.</p>

<p>Although policy differences resulted in vastly different prison populations
and their associated costs, the two paths taken by Florida and New York
did not result in different outcomes when it came to crimes committed.
Both states saw crime rates decrease significantly since 2000. New York’s
crime rate is down 36%, and Florida’s, though still higher than New York’s, is down 42%.<sup>13</sup></p>

<h3 id="prison-populations-have-increased-far-faster-than-the-general-population">Prison populations have increased far faster than the general population.</h3>
<p>The US prison population has septupled since 1970. In 1970, Florida
had the third highest imprisonment rate in the country -
of each 100,000 residents, 135 were prisoners. Oklahoma (with an imprisonment rate of 142
per 100,000 residents) led the nation in imprisonment. Today, Massachusetts, the state
 with the country’s <em>lowest</em> imprisonment (146 per 100,000 residents) has
a higher state imprisonment rate than the highest (Oklahoma) in 1970. (It is worth noting
that Massachusetts’ imprisonment rate is deflated because it
sentences many people to incarceration in local jails instead of prison;
its total incarceration rate is significantly higher.) If Florida had today the same imprisonment rate it had in 1970, it would confine 71,000 fewer
people in its prisons. If the costs per prisoner remained the same, the state
would avoid <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> in corrections expenses every year.<sup>14</sup></p>

<p>For decades, Florida legislators have known that prisons are costly and inefficient,
and they have occasionally taken steps to reduce the state’s over-reliance on
incarceration. The Legislature established (and later repealed) a ceiling
for the prison population. It instituted procedures to allow prison and parole
administrators to release people before the end of their sentence—at times
to address overcrowding and in response to litigation, but also as a way
to incentivize good behavior and in recognition of prisoners’ ultimate
return to Florida communities. On
numerous occasions, the Legislature
appropriated money to improve rehabilitation programs.</p>

<p>None of these efforts has been successful in reducing Florida’s prison
population, in large part because the
Legislature almost simultaneously took actions that pushed the criminal
justice system in the opposite direction. Legislators increased penalties for drugs
(in 1987, 1989, 1992, 1994 and more), ratcheted up punitive
 responses across the board, and slowly stripped judges of
 their power and discretion, effectively
transferring authority from judges to prosecutors.</p>

<p>When these policies predictably
resulted in an extremely high rate of incarceration, state policy makers
took steps to hide the costs from taxpayers, borrowing billions of dollars
 and shifting the costs to future.
From 1987 to 2011,
the state embarked on an unprecedented construction spree, building 46
new prisons and 34 new smaller facilities.<sup>15</sup></p>

<h4 id="a-ceiling-on-the-prison-population">A ceiling on the prison population.</h4>
<p>In 1983, the Florida Legislature passed a law that it hoped would
act as a “reasonable containment of criminal justice expenditures.”
It placed a ceiling on the number of prisoners the state could confine –
275 per 100,000 residents. The legislation provided that, over time and
as Florida invested in noncustodial alternatives to incarceration,
this ceiling would fall to 250 prisoners per 100,000 residents. By way of comparison,
Florida’s state imprisonment rate today is 500 per 100,000 residents.
(This figure reflects only the state prison population, and does not include
people confined in county jails, federal prisons, or juvenile lockup facilities.)</p>

<div class="col-lg-6 col-sm-6">
 <div class="textbox">
    <h4><i>Costello v. Wainwright</i></h4>
     <small> In 1972, inmates in the Florida prison system filed a class
     action suit (Costello v. Wainwright) against the State of Florida, c
     Citing issues of prison overcrowding, sanitation and health care
     deficiencies. The State of Florida spent the next 21 years in
     litigation and under the supervision of the Federal government. Over the period of a whole generation, Florida responded through a variety of strategies in order to satisfy the Court. In terms of addressing overcrowding, responses could be summed up in two categories: 1) attempts to control the growth of the prison population; and 2) prison construction to answer projections of growth driven by an increasingly more punitive sentencing structure. The second strategy prevailed, resulting in tens of thousands new beds.
     </small>
 </div>
 </div>

<p>The Legislature was motivated not only by the expenses of building and
maintaining prisons, but also by recognition  that incarceration was
not the only method nor, under certain circumstances, the most effective way of ensuring public safety and rehabilitating people in prison. The 1983 legislation provided increased funds for alternatives to incarceration, and was, in part, motivated by the Legislature’s observation that  “The effectiveness of incarceration …
 is not conclusively positive.”<sup>16</sup></p>

<h4 id="small-steps-reduced-confinement">Small steps reduced confinement.</h4>
<p>The Legislature took some steps to keep Florida’s prison population below
the 1983 ceiling. In 1987, it introduced “administrative gain time,”
a process by which prisoners who behaved well while in prison received
time off of their sentences.<sup>17</sup></p>

<h4 id="countervailing-policies-grew-the-system">Countervailing policies grew the system.</h4>
<p>Efforts to limit the number of people in Florida’s prisons were quickly overwhelmed by the effects of policies and practices that drew more people into the criminal justice system. New laws increased penalties for drug offenses, lengthened sentences for  many types of offenses, and ensured that prisoners would spend more time in prison.<sup>18</sup></p>

<p>Instead of paying for
prison construction with cash through payments
known as “fixed capital appropriation” (a more rigorous and scrutinized process of state budgeting), a newly-empowered state agency
named the Correctional Privatization Commission took out enormous loans
to build new prison facilities. Even after the Correctional
Privatization Commission was shut down (due to a flurry
of corruption scandals), Florida continued to borrow money to build new
prisons. Between FY2006 and FY2011, the state spent or borrowed almost
$1.5 billion to pay for prison construction. This spending
paid for prisons to be constructed in Lafayette, Gadsden, Marion,
Washington, Wakulla, Jackson, Polk,
Santa Rosa, and Suwanee Counties.<sup>19</sup></p>

<p>In 2015, Florida still owed more than $500
million in principle of the debts it incurred for prison construction. By
the time Florida pays off these debts in 2030, taxpayers will have paid
an additional $690 million in debt service.<sup>20</sup></p>

                    <div class="lead"><p>This report uses two methodologies for determining an individual’s offense: “committing” offense and “longest” offense. Both are result from an analysis of data provided by the Florida Department of Corrections.
By either measure, non-violent offenses account for a significant
majority of prison admissions.</p>

<h3 id="committing-offense">Committing Offense</h3>
<p>The Committing Offense is the most serious charge for which an individual is sentenced to prison.
It prioritizes violent offenses over property, drug, and other offenses. The Committing Offense
variable captures violations of probation, parole, and conditional release.<sup>21</sup></p>

<h3 id="longest-sentenced-offense">Longest Sentenced Offense</h3>
<p>The Longest Sentenced Offense is the offense that carries the longest sentence, regardless of the
seriousness of the offense. However, when two offenses carry the same sentence, this variable, like
Committing Offense, prioritizes violence. In cases where an individual is admitted to prison for a
violation of probation or parole, the Longest Sentenced Offense reveals the underlying charge, not the violation.</p>

<h3 id="whats-the-difference-between-these-definitions">What’s the difference between these definitions?</h3>
<p>Committing Offense is most valuable in determining why someone
was sentenced to prison. In showing probation and parole violations,
it emphasizes the role that parallel criminal justice institutions play in mass incarceration
and highlights reforms in <em>practice</em> that could be implemented administratively.</p>

<p>Longest Sentenced Offense is most useful in understanding what changes in law
are required to reduce the number of people Florida holds in prison, particularly as they
might relate to sentencing.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Policy decisions drive prison admissions for violations of probation, which cost Florida taxpayers more than $100 million a year.</h3>
                    <div class="lead">Probation violations (VOPs) comprised 15% of prison admissions.
In FY2015, 5,712 people were in prison due to a VOP,
 costing the state more than $107 million.

Prison admissions for violations of probation are in large part driven by Department of Corrections policy. This is because most VOP admissions are precipitated by technical violations. Technical violations
are behaviors that are against the rules of probation -- like missing a curfew deadline -- but are not by themselves against the law. It is important to note that
although violations of probation sometimes consist of serious new law violations, previous studies have found that only 25% of people admitted to prison for a violation of probation had been recently arrested for a felony; most had not been arrested for a new offense.<sup>22</sup></div>

                <div class="lead">The Department of Corrections, along with courts, have broad discretion
in how to treat technical violations and other misbehavior that, itself,
does not violate the law. From 2003 until mid-2008, the Department of Corrections
maintained a "Zero Tolerance" policy regarding technical violations. This
meant probation officers were required to file violations whenever someone
under their supervision was not in full compliance -- even when an officer
believed lack of full compliance did not threaten public safety.

Predictably, the Zero Tolerance policy resulted in many more people
being sent to prison for violations of probation. By FY2008, admissions
for violations of probation increased two-and-a-half fold.

Since the Department rescinded its Zero Tolerance policy, admissions
for VOPs are down significantly. Between FY2008 and
FY2012, VOPs fell 35%. Since 2012, prison admissions for VOPs have increased slightly. They remain 33% higher than they were prior to the Zero Tolerance policy.

<small><small>In 2016, the Florida Legislature passed a bill that created an "Alternative Sanction Program." The program, which had been piloted since 2013, allows judges to opt to use alternative responses to technical violations. The program is intended to increase efficiency, improve outcomes, and decrease revocations.</small></small>

were on probation for a non-violent offense. The most common
underlying offenses (the offenses for which an individual was under
probation supervision) involved drugs and property.

The majority of probation violators in FY2015 had no
record of a violent felony in their Florida Department of Corrections
record. (This includes only cases sentenced to state prison or
a form of community supervision.)

<small><small> Note: A small  number of cases of violations of probation involved
very serious offenses, such as murder and some sex offenses,
provoking the question of why people with very serious offenses were
placed on probation. These cases mostly involved the use of blended
sentences: A court sentenced the initial offense to a term of imprisonment
followed by a term of probation. This mean that, after serving the full term
 of imprisonment, individuals with such sentences were placed on probation
 after their release. Like anyone on probation, these individuals
 could have their probation revoked for failing to fully comply with
 its terms. Most people whose underlying offense was very serious
 had already served a prison sentence before their probation was revoked.</small></small>

Racial and jurisdictional disparities are most apparent in analyses of less serious cases (like drug offense and probation violations) where decision-makers

Statewide, one in 42 black adults was incarcerated by the Florida Department of Corrections in a FY2015 snapshot. For white adults, the figure was one in 229. Florida's 19th Circuit (Okeechobee) had the most severe racial disparities. One in 24 black adults in the 19th Circuit was imprisoned in FY2015 -- more than eleven times the rate of their white neighbors.

Florida's different jurisdictions produce disparate results. White adults in the 3rd Circuit (Lake City and its environs) were twice as likely than whites in the 19th Circuit (Okeechobee), three times more likely than whites in the 17th Circuit (Fort Lauderdale) and almost five times more likely than whites in the 11th (Miami) and 15th Circuits (Palm Beach) to be imprisoned.

In almost every circuit in Florida, the incarceration rate of black adults solely for drugs
is higher than the total incarceration rate for similar countries. The 15th Circuit (Palm Beach) has a drug incarceration rate
for black adults of 173 per 100,000. The United Kingdom's incarceration rate for _all offenses_ is 187 per 100,000.<sup>24</sup>

When racial and jurisdictional differences compound, the disparities can be astounding. Black adults in the 19th Circuit (Okeechobee) are 110 times more likely to be incarcerated for drugs than white adults in Palm Beach. Put another way, if the general populations were equivalent, for every white prisoner incarcerated for drugs from Palm Beach there would be 110 black prisoners from Okeechobee.

Though to a less extreme degree, white Floridians are also heavily impacted by the War on Drugs. In some rural areas,
such as the 3rd (Lake City) and 14th (Panama City) Circuits, the white adult drug incarceration rates are 194 and 149,
respectively.

                    <div class="lead">Fifty-five percent of Florida's prison population was incarcerated for a violent offense in a FY2015 snapshot. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Florida Legislature passed laws with slogans like "truth in sentencing" and "life means life," and abolished parole and other forms of discretionary release. These laws and policies have resulted in people staying in prison for extremely long periods of time, often beyond the point where they ceased to be a risk to public safety. Mandatory minimum sentences (especially 10-20-Life) also forced judges to impose extremely long prison sentences. Florida is one of only a handful of states that does not have a system for releasing people who served significant periods of time and do not pose a risk to public safety.

Nearly one in four people in Florida's prisons (23,500 individuals) was elderly (50 or older) in 2016. Elderly inmates demographic group that costs the state significantly more to imprison, especially in expenses related to health care.<sup>27</sup><br>

<iframe src="DataVisualizations/recidbyage.html" height='400' width='960' frameborder='0' scrolling='no'></iframe>

Criminological studies have shown that most people age out of criminal behavior by age thirty. In general, as people age, they are much less likely to engage in crime.<sup>28</sup>

Data tracking the re-imprisonment of people released from Florida prisons reflects these broader trends. Only 2% of people age 60 or older released from Florida prisons between FY2005 and FY2010 were re-imprisoned for a violent felony within five years of their release. Overall, 19% of people 60 and older returned to prison, but 32% of these recidivists were re-incarcerated for a violation - not a new offense.

<small><small>Note: The methodology of this recidivism analysis differs from that of the Florida Department of Corrections in several ways. This analysis identified all people released from Florida prisons between July 1, 2005 and June 30, 2010, and followed each of them for five years. An individual was considered a recidivist if he or she returned to prison within the five-year time frame, in which case the reason for his or her return was recorded. If an individual appeared multiple times in the sample (i.e., he or she was released from Florida prisons twice during the study period) both releases were included in the sample. (The Florida Department of Corrections considers only "first releases," or the very first time an individual was released from their facilities. All subsequent entries and releases are excluded from FDC's analyses.)<sup>29</sup></small></small>

### Since the Florida Department of Corrections began keeping electronic records, nearly two million people have come into the custody or under the supervision of the Department of Corrections.

With 99,000 in prison, 137,000 under supervision, 20,000 employed, an annual budget of $2.4 billion, and a digitally-recorded historical footprint approaching 2 million, the scale of Florida's prison complex is vast by any measure.<sup>32</sup>

### Appendix A: Four practical examples how Committing Offense and Longest Sentenced Offense methodologies differ.
1. **A Single Offense, No Probation to Consider:** In the simplest of cases, someone is convicted of a single offense and sentenced directly to prison, with no prior term of probation. In this case, the offense for which he or she was convicted - be it drugs, burglary, or assault - appears as both the Committing Offense and the Longest Sentenced Offense. Since FY1998, 29% of people admitted to prison had cases like this.

2. **Multiple Offenses:** When someone is sent to prison for multiple offenses, a ranking system is required to identify the single most important offense. The definitions in this report use different ranking systems, occasionally producing different results. For instance, if a prisoner was sentenced to three years for assault and also sentenced to twelve years for a drug offense, his Committing Offense would be the assault charge while the Longest Sentenced Offense would be the drug offense.

3. **Probation and Parole Violations:** 30% of people sentenced to prison in Florida since FY1998 were sentenced to prison for a violation of probation. If an individual was sentenced to probation for burglary and subsequently sentenced to prison for a violation of the terms of probation, his or her Committing Offense would be a violation of Probation. The Longest Sentenced Offense would be burglary.

4. **Multiple Offenses and Probation Violations:** Some people committed new offenses while on probation, and were sentenced to prison both for a violation of probation and for a new offense. Take someone on probation for assault who violated probation and was sentenced to prison for a new burglary charge. If both cases were sentenced to the same amount of time, the Committing Offense would be burglary (it was the offense that most proximally precipitated his incarceration), and the Longest Sentenced Offense would be assault (Longest Sentenced Offense ignores violations of probation and, if sentence lengths are equal, prioritizes more violent offenses.</div>

For a full explanation of the data, see [notes on the raw data](docs/ImprisonmentRatesofTotalJurisdictionalPopulation_BJS_NPS.xls) (clicking here will download an excel file).

21. In this chart, Parole Violations refer to multiple types of conditional release that administered by the Florida Commission on Offender Review. Parole was largely abolished in 1983, meaning only people sentenced prior to 1983 (with the exception of people convicted of capital offenses prior to 1994) are under the parole system. The Commission on Offender Review nonetheless administrates several other forms of conditional release, including Conditional Release, Control Release Program, Conditional Medical Release, and the Addiction Recovery Supervision Program. In FY2016, the Florida Commission on Offender Review revoked 1,835 conditional releases (of one form or another), making it a significant contributor to Florida's prison population. For a full account of the role of the Florida Commission on Offender Review, see Florida Commission on Offender Review, [2016 Annual Report](https://www.fcor.state.fl.us/docs/reports/FCORannualreport201516.pdf).

17. Since Florida effectively abolished parole in 1983, more than a dozen states followed. Most states, however, maintain mechanisms for discretionary release. For more details about the national context of parole and discretionary release, see Joan Petersilia, Edward Rhine, and Kevin Reitz, "The Future of Parole Release," in _Justice Futures: Reinventing American Criminal Justice, Vol. 42 of Crime and Justice: A Review of Research_, Michael Tonry, ed. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press), 2017.

22. The Florida Department of Corrections adopted (relatively) full-scale digitization in 1998. Since then, more than 458,000 people have been prisoners in the state of Florida. Just over 99,000 of them are in prison today. 5,284 people have died in prison since 1998. The vast majority of the people who have been in prison -- more than 350,000 -- were released back into their communities. The Florida Department of Corrections digitized probation records in 1976. Since then, it has released almost 1.4 million people from supervision. Another 137,000 remain under the supervision of the Department of Corrections. Figures relating to prisoners, former prisoners, and current probationers are from the [April 2017 Public Records Requests for the OBIS Database](http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/obis_request.html), maintained by the Florida Department of Corrections. Figures regarding former probationers are from a datas et proved to the Project on Accountable Justice by the Florida Department of Corrections titled "Former Probationers."
