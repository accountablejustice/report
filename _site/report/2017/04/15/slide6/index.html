No other country incarcerates this many people. The US incarceration rate, of 698 people per one

has a relatively high rate of incarceration compared to other economically developed democracies.
Only Cuba and Russia, both with non-democratic governments, begin to approach
the United States when it comes to incarceration.<sup>1<sup></sup></sup></p>

<p><small>Note: North Korea does not provide reliable data, but the
<a href="https://www.hrnk.org/uploads/pdfs/HRNK_HiddenGulag2_Web_5-18.pdf">best estimates available</a>
conclude that confines between 150,000 and 200,000 people, resulting in
 an incarceration rate between 600 and 800 <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL">per 100,000 residents</a>.
These data indicate that North Korea is the
only country whose incarceration rate may be higher than that of the

<p>Mass incarceration affects all of the United States, but only California
and Texas have larger prison populations than Florida. Louisiana, Oklahoma,
and Delaware have the highest rates of incarceration. Florida’s imprisonment rate
(500 prisoners per 100,000 residents of all ages) is 20% higher than the
national average.</p>

<h2 id="until-2000-new-york-and-florida-had-similar-prison-populations-and-imprisonment-rates-today-florida-incarcerates-twice-as-many-people">Until 2000, New York and Florida had similar prison populations and imprisonment rates. Today, Florida incarcerates twice as many people.</h2>
<p>As you watch the size of each state’s prison population expand,
compare the trajectories of New York and Florida. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s,
the two states had similar prison populations and similar rates of imprisonment.
Both states were early adopters of laws that increased penalties for drugs
and lengthened sentences for violent offenses. After 2000, however, the
two states diverged. New York scaled back its War on Drugs and maintained
parole as a method to release people it deemed to pose little threat to
public safety. Florida, on the other hand, doubled down on drug offenses -
passing laws to increase penalties for opioids and making it possession
charges easier to prosecute. Florida also passed a law called “10 - 20 - Life,”
which established mandatory minimum sentences for people who used a gun
during a crime. (Some people sentenced to twenty years in prison
never hurt anyone and fired a warning shot in self defense.) Florida’s abolition
of parole in 1983 also limited the ability of the state to release people
who no longer are dangerous. These policy divergences have culminated
in a profound difference: Florida has almost twice as many prisoners
as New York.</p>

<p>Although policy differences resulted in vastly different prison populations
and their associated costs, the two paths taken by Florida and New York
did not result in different outcomes when it came to crimes committed.
Both states saw crime rates decrease significantly since 2000. New York’s
crime rate is down 29%, and Florida’s is down 28%.</p>

<h2 id="prison-populations-have-increased-far-faster-than-the-general-population">Prison populations have increased far faster than the general population.</h2>
<p>The US prison population has septupled since 1970. In 1970, Florida
had the third highest imprisonment rate in the country -
of each 100,000 residents, 135 were prisoners. Oklahoma (with an imprisonment rate of 142
per 100,000 residents) led the nation in imprisonment. Today, Massachusetts, the state
 with the the country’s <em>lowest</em> imprisonment (146 per 100,000 residents) has
a higher imprisonment rate than Oklahoma had in 1970. (It is worth noting
that Massachusetts’ imprisonment rate is deflated because it
sentences many people to incarceration in local jails instead of prison;
its total incarceration rate is significantly higher.) If Florida today
and the same imprisonment rate it had in 1970, it would confine 71,000 fewer
people in its prisons. If the costs per prisoner remained the same, the state
would avoid <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> in corrections expenses every year.</p>

                <div class="lead"><h2 id="floridas-criminal-justice-policies-have-often-been-at-cross-purposes">Florida’s criminal justice policies have often been at cross-purposes.</h2>
<p>For decades, legislators have known that prisons are costly and inefficient,
and they have occasionally taken steps to reduce the state’s over-reliance on
incarceration. The Legislature established (and later repealed) a ceiling
for the prison population. It instituted procedures to allow prison and parole
administrators to release people before the end of their sentence. And, on
numerous occasions, it
appropriated money to improve rehabilitation programs.</p>

<p>None of these efforts has been successful, in large part because the
Legislature almost simultaneously took actions that pushed the criminal
justice system in the opposite direction. Legislators increased penalties for drugs
(in 1987, 1989, 1992, 1994 and more) and slowly stripped judges of
 their authority and discretion, effectively
transferring authority from judges to prosecutors.</p>

<p>When these policies predictably
resulted in an extremely high rate of incarceration, state policy makers
took steps to hide the costs from taxpayers. From 1987 to 2011,
the state embarked on an unprecedented construction spree, building 46
new prisons and 34 new smaller facilities.</p>

<h3 id="a-ceiling-on-the-prison-population">A ceiling on the prison population.</h3>
<p>In 1983, the Florida Legislature passed a law that it hoped would
act as a “reasonable containment of criminal justice expenditures.”
It placed a ceiling on the number of prisoners the state could confine –
275 per 100,000 residents. The legislation provided that, over time and
as Florida invested in noncustodial alternatives to incarceration,
this ceiling would fall to 250 prisoners per 100,000 residents. By way of comparison,
Florida’s state imprisonment rate today is 500 per 100,000 residents.
(This figure reflects only the state prison population, and does not include
people confined in county jails, federal prisons, or juvenile lockup facilities.)</p>

<p>The Legislature was motivated not only by the expenses of building
and maintaining prisons, but also by a sense that incarceration was
neither an effective means of ensuring public safety nor of rehabilitating
criminals. The 1983 legislation provided increased funds for
alternatives to incarceration, and was, in part, motivated by the Legislature’s
obersvation that “The effectiveness of incarceration …
 is not conclusively positive.”</p>

<h3 id="partial-steps-to-reduce-confinement">Partial steps to reduce confinement.</h3>
<p>The Legislature took some steps to keep Florida’s prison population below
the 1983 ceiling. In 1987, it introduced “administrative gain time,”
a process by which prisoners who behaved well while in prison received
time off of their sentences.</p>

<h3 id="countervailing-policies-that-grew-the-system">Countervailing policies that grew the system.</h3>
<p>(These figures count
annexes to
<a href="http://www.dc.state.fl.us/pub/annual/1011/facil.html">existing institutions as new facilities.</a>)
Instead of paying for
prison construction out with cash (through payments
known as “fixed capital appropriation”), a newly-empowered state agency
named the Correctional Privatization Commission took out enormous loans
to build new prison facilities. Even after the Correctional
Privatization Commission was shut down (due to a flurry
of corruption scandals), Florida continued to borrow money to build new
prisons. Between FY2006 and FY2011, the state spent or borrowed almost
$1.5 billion to pay for prison construction. This spending
paid for prisons to be constructed in Lafayette, Gadsden, Marion,
Washington, Wakulla, Jackson, Polk,
Santa Rosa, and Suwanee Counties.</p>

<p>In 2015, Florida still owed more than $500
million in principle of the debts it incurred for prison construction. By
the time it pays off these debts in 2030, the state will have paid
an additional $690 million in debt service. (page 20 of FY2015 renegotiation.)</p>

                    <div class="lead">This report uses two methodologies for determining an individual's offense.
By either measure, non-violent offenses account for a significant
majority of prison admissions.

Multiple offense methodologies are required

### Committing Offense
The Committing Offense is the most serious charge for which an individual is sentenced to prison.
It prioritizes violent offenses over property, drug, and other offenses. The Committing Offense
variable captures violations of probation, parole, and conditional release.

### Longest Sentenced Offense
The Longest Sentenced Offense is the offense that carries the longest sentence, regardless of the
seriousness of the offense. However, when two offenses carry the same sentence, this variable, like
Committing Offense, prioritizes violence. In cases where an individual is admitted to prison for a
violation of probation or parole, the Longest Sentenced Offense reveals the underlying charge.</div>

Committing Offense is most valuable in determining why someone
was sentenced to prison. In showing probation and parole violations,
it emphasizes the role that parallel criminal justice institutions play in mass incarceration
and highlights reforms in _practice_ that could be implemented administratively.

Longest Sentenced Offense is most useful in understanding what changes in law
are required to reduce the number of people Florida holds in prison, particularly as they
might relate to sentencing.

                    <div class="lead">Probation violations (VOPs) comprised 15% of prison admissions.
In FY2015, 5,712 people were in prison due to a VOP,
 costing the state more than $107 million.

Prison admissions for violations of probation are in large part driven
by Department of Corrections policy. This is because most
VOP admissions are precipitated by technical violations. Technical violations
are behaviors that are against the rules of probation -- like missing a
curfew deadline -- but are against the law. (It is important to note that
although violations of probation sometimes consist of serious new law violations,
previous studies have found that only 27% people admitted to prison for a
violation of probation had been recently arrested for a felony.)</div>

                <div class="lead">The Department of Corrections, along with courts, have broad discretion
in how to treat technical violations and other misbehavior that, itself,
does not violate the law. From 2003 until mid-2008, the Department of Corrections
maintained a "Zero Tolerance" policy regarding technical violations. This
meant probation officers were required to file violations whenever someone
under their supervision was not in full compliance -- even when an officer
believed lack of full compliance did not threaten public safety.

Predictably, the Zero Tolerance policy resulted in many more people
being sent to prison for violations of probation. By FY2008, admissions
for violations of probation increased two-and-a-half fold.

Since the Department rescinded its Zero Tolerance policy, admissions
for violations of probation are down significantly. Between, FY2008 and
FY2012, they fell 35%. Since 2012, prison admissions for violations of
probation have increased slightly. They remain 33% higher than

                    <div class="lead">More than 70% of people sent to prison or violations of probation in FY2015
were on probation for a non-violent offense. The most common
underlying offenses (the offenses for which an individual was under
probation supervision) involved drugs and property.

The majority of probation violators in FY2015 had no
record of a violent felony in their Florida Department of Corrections
record. (This includes only cases sentenced to state prison or
a form of community supervision.)

<sub> Note: A small  number of cases of violations of probation involved
very serious offenses, such as murder and some sex offenses,
provoking the question of why people with very serious offenses were
placed on probation. These cases mostly involved the use of blended
sentences: A court sentenced the initial offense to a term of imprisonment
followed by a term of probation. This mean that, after serving the full term
 of imprisonment, individuals with such sentences were placed on probation
 after their release. Like anyone on probation, these individuals
 could have their probation revoked for failing to fully comply with
 its terms. Most people whose underlying offense was very serious
 had already served a prison sentence before having their probation revoked.<sub>

                    <div class="lead">In Florida's criminal justice system, your ZIP code and
the color of your skin can sometimes matter more than your behavior.
Disparities between circuits are a product of the criminal justice
system's relative de-centralization. Each circuit has its own
judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, probation officers,
and police forces. The decisions these people make -- individually
and collectively -- determine whom is punished and how.

Racial and jurisdictional disparities are most apparent at the
"lower ends" of the criminal justice system where decision-makers
have more discretion. Florida's criminal justice system
produces significant racial and jurisdictional disparities, especially
in the enforcement of the terms of probation and of drug offenses.</div>

In every circuit except for the 9th (Orlando) and 11th (Miami), the incarceration rate of black adults solely for drugs
is higher than the total incarceration rate for similar countries. The 17th (Palm Beach) has a drug incarceration rate
for black adults of 149 per 100,000. The United Kingdom's incarceration rate for _all offenses_ is 147 per 100,000.

Though to a less extreme degree, white Floridians are also heavily impacted by the War on Drugs. In some rural areas,
such as the 3rd (Lake City) and 14th (Panama City) Circuits, the white adult drug incarcerate rates are 194 and 149,
